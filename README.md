# Samantha AI Conversational Assistant

Samantha AI is a voice-enabled conversational assistant designed to assist users with a variety of tasks, from scheduling and email management to emotional support and entertainment. Built with a focus on natural language understanding and empathetic responses, Samantha leverages advanced AI models and APIs to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

Samantha AI offers a wide range of features to cater to different user needs:

- **Voice and Text Interaction**:
  - Accepts voice input via microphone (using speech recognition) and responds with synthesized speech.
  - Supports text-based input through a web frontend for flexible interaction.

- **Natural Language Understanding**:
  - Powered by the Mistral-7B model for generating context-aware responses.
  - Maintains conversation history for coherent and personalized interactions.

- **Emotion Analysis**:
  - Uses the `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions` model to detect user emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).
  - Adjusts response tone based on detected emotions (e.g., empathetic for sadness, cheerful for happiness).

- **Scheduling and Calendar Management**:
  - Integrates with Google Calendar API to schedule, modify, and delete events.
  - Provides daily event summaries (e.g., "What’s on my schedule today?").

- **Email Management**:
  - Integrates with Gmail API to send, read, and search emails.
  - Example: "Send an email to John about the meeting" or "Read my recent emails."

- **Entertainment and Information**:
  - Fetches random jokes and quotes from external APIs to entertain users.
  - Provides time and date information (e.g., "What’s the time?").

- **App Launching**:
  - Launches applications on the user’s system (e.g., Notepad, Calculator, VS Code).
  - Example: "Open Notepad" or "Launch VS Code."

- **Recipe Guidance**:
  - Offers step-by-step recipe instructions (currently hardcoded, with potential for API integration).
  - Example: "How do I make a sandwich?"

- **Memory and Context Awareness**:
  - Stores conversation history in `knowledge.json` for context-aware responses.
  - Tracks user preferences (e.g., favorite games, travel destinations) to personalize interactions.

- **Web Frontend**:
  - Provides a user-friendly React-based interface to interact with Samantha via text or voice.
  - Plays audio responses generated by the backend using ElevenLabs.

## Technologies Used

Samantha AI is built using a combination of modern technologies for both backend and frontend, ensuring robust performance and scalability.

### Backend
- **Python**: Core programming language for the backend (`sam11.py`).
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework to create a REST API for frontend-backend communication.
- **Mistral-7B**: A 7-billion-parameter language model from Hugging Face for natural language generation.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Library to load and use the Mistral-7B and emotion analysis models.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model inference, with 4-bit quantization to optimize performance.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Python library for capturing voice input via microphone.
- **ElevenLabs API**: Text-to-speech service for generating high-quality audio responses with mood variations.
- **Google Calendar API**: For scheduling and managing calendar events.
- **Google Gmail API**: For email-related tasks (send, read, search).
- **RoBERTa (SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions)**: Pre-trained model for emotion analysis.
- **Requests**: HTTP library for fetching external data (e.g., jokes, quotes).
- **Pygame**: For audio playback of ElevenLabs-generated responses.
- **python-dateutil**: For parsing and manipulating dates in scheduling tasks.

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For frontend logic and API interactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
- **Web Speech API** (assumed, based on typical voice-enabled React apps): For browser-based voice input (if implemented).
- **Axios** (assumed): For making HTTP requests to the Flask backend.
- **Node.js/NPM**: For managing frontend dependencies and running the development server.

### Other Tools
- **Git**: Version control system for managing the codebase.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the repository at `https://github.com/arpanmathur27/SamanthaAI-Conversational-AI-`.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: For running the backend.
- **Node.js 16+ and NPM**: For the frontend.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Google Cloud Account**: For Calendar and Gmail API credentials (`credentials.json`).
- **ElevenLabs API Key**: For text-to-speech functionality.
- **Hugging Face Token** (optional): If using restricted models.

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # OR
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
   ```
5. Place `credentials.json` (from Google Cloud Console) in the `backend/` directory.
6. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python sam11.py
   ```
   The Flask server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The React app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Open the frontend in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
- Use voice or text input to interact with Samantha.
- Example commands:
  - "Schedule a meeting at 3 PM tomorrow."
  - "Tell me a joke."
  - "What’s the time?"
  - "Send an email to alice@example.com about the project."
  - "Open VS Code."
  - "I’m feeling sad—can you help?"

Samantha will respond with text (displayed on the frontend) and audio (played through your browser).
